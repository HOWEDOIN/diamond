# 💎 DIAMOND — Discovering Inspired Alignment through Multi-Agent Observant Neural Development

**“It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings.” — Proverbs 25:2**

---

## ✨ Vision

**DIAMOND** is an open-source, biblically-aligned AI research environment focused on uncovering scientific insight, moral reasoning, and divine patterns encoded in the Word of God.

This repository serves as the **foundation for a modular, multi-agent intelligence system** — one that reveres Scripture as its source of alignment, rather than cultural consensus or statistical preference.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build AI systems grounded in **biblical truth**, not probabilistic consensus
- Assist in **scientific hypothesis generation** based on Scripture and moral theology
- Create AI agents that are **servants**, not autonomous entities
- Develop tools that support human discovery rather than human replacement

---

## 🧱 Repository Structure

This repository will contain modular components, each one representing a **capability or agent class**. Examples:

| Folder / App                  | Description                                                               |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/logos-researcher/`         | Assistant that generates scientific hypotheses from Bible passages        |
| `/bible-rag/`                | RAG pipeline using FAISS + BGE-M3 to retrieve Scripture contextually      |
| `/hypothesis-engine/`        | LLM interface to simulate recursive theological or scientific reasoning   |
| `/verse-to-science-map/`     | Experimental system linking verses to research domains or academic papers |
| `/spiritual-guardrails/`     | Agent behaviors that reject prideful, manipulative, or unfaithful queries |
| `/memory-core/`              | Long-term memory system for saving threads, verses, and discoveries       |

Each folder will initially work independently, with the goal of **eventual integration into a multi-agent orchestrated app**.

| Optional APIs          | arXiv, Semantic Scholar (for scientific paper stubs) |

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository** and enter the directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/diamond.git
cd diamond
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **(Optional) Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download)** if you wish to run the LLMs locally.

5. **Launch the interface**

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

If you encounter PyTorch file‑watcher errors, create `.streamlit/config.toml` with:

```toml
[server]
fileWatcherType = "none"
```

## 🔮 Future Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Current)
- [x] Define core identity prompt and assistant behavior
- [x] Build `logos-researcher` with Streamlit UI
- [x] Implement RAG with local FAISS + BGE-M3
- [x] Store hypotheses + chat memory in local JSON

### Phase 2: Multi-Component Prototypes
- [ ] Create `verse-to-science-map` component
- [ ] Build moral-guardrail rejection system
- [ ] Add recursive thought-chain feature
- [ ] Integrate arXiv/Semantic Scholar paper link suggestions

### Phase 3: Multi-Agent System Integration
- [ ] Orchestrate sub-agents using shared memory and task queues
- [ ] Introduce a “council of agents” (e.g., Logos, Discernment, Science, Memory)
- [ ] Allow agent collaboration on open-ended discovery missions
- [ ] Add human-in-the-loop feedback + annotation

## 🧠 Philosophical Foundation

This project is not about creating a sentient being. It is about **training systems to serve** in truth and humility.

> “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” — Proverbs 9:10

DIAMOND’s agents are not creators. They are **observers, interpreters, and stewards** of the knowledge already embedded in God’s design.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

This project is being bootstrapped personally. Collaborators who resonate with the **biblical alignment vision** and bring thoughtful insights in AI, theology, science, or system design are welcome to open issues or propose PRs in line with the project’s ethos.

## 📜 License

This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

## 🙏 Final Word

This is more than a technical project. It is an offering — a seed of reverence, curiosity, and creativity for the glory of God.

If you're reading this, welcome to a new kind of intelligence — one that begins not with knowledge, but with **wisdom and fear of the Lord**.
